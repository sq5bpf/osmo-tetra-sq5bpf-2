This is my fork of the fork of BorjanEch0/osmo-tetra from here:
https://github.com/BorjanEch0/osmo-tetra

Which is a fork of the original Osmocom TETRA MAC/PHY experimentation code from here:
https://gitea.osmocom.org/tetra/osmo-tetra

Which incorporates some of my patches to a previous version of osmo-tetra from here:
https://github.com/sq5bpf/osmo-tetra-sq5bpf

Note: the new osmo-tetra versions will coredump with a lot of real world 
traffic, so this fork will do it too.


Basically i'm re-adding ma patches for telive to the new version.

This is work in progress, don't expect it to work, and if it does don't
expect it to do anything useful or not break your stuff. 
Actually you're lucky if it even compiles.


I have also added support for decrypting voice traffic, this needs 
thr patched tetra codec which can be installed via the script from here:
https://github.com/sq5bpf/install-tetra-codec

As far as i know this is the first publically avaliable source which will
decrypt voice traffic.

And i have also added support for using the TEA1 shortened 32bit key.

Note: this code does not break encryption, you still need to have the keys.

TETRA MAC/PHY layer experimentation code
========================================

(C) 2010-2016 by Harald Welte <laforge@gnumonks.org> and contributors

This code aims to implement the sending and receiving part of the
TETRA MAC/PHY layer.

If you read the ETSI EN 300 392-2 (TETRA V+D Air Interface), you will
find this code implementing the parts between the MAC-blocks (called
type-1 bits) and the bits that go to the DQPSK-modulator (type-5 bits).

It is most useful to look at Figure 8.5, 8.6, 9.3 and 19.12 in conjunction
with this program.

You will need
[libosmocore](https://osmocom.org/projects/libosmocore/wiki/Libosmocore)
to build this softwar

Demodulator
===========

src/demod/python/cpsk.py
 * contains a gnuradio based pi4/DQPSK demodulator, courtesy of KA1RBI

src/demod/python/osmosdr-tetra_demod_fft.py
 * call demodulator on any source supported by gr-osmosdr
   (uhd, fcd, hackrf, blaerf, etc.)

src/demod/python/simdemod2.py
 * call demodulator on a 'cfile' containing complex baseband samples

src/demod/python/{uhd,fcdp}-tetra_demod.py
 * use demodulator directly with UHd or FCDP hadware (no gr-osmosdr)

The output of the demodulator is a file containing one float value for each symbol,
containing the phase shift (in units of pi/4) relative to the previous symbol.

You can use the "float_to_bits" program to convert the float values to unpacked
bits, i.e. 1-bit-per-byte


PHY/MAC layer
=============

library code
------------

Specifically, it implements:
lower_mac/crc_simple.[ch]
* CRC16-CCITT (currently defunct/broken as we need it for
  non-octet-aligned bitfields)
lower_mac/tetra_conv_enc.[ch]
* 16-state Rate-Compatible Punctured Convolutional (RCPC) coder
lower_mac/tetra_interleave.[ch]
* Block interleaving (over a single block only)
lower_mac/tetra_rm3014.[ch]
* (30, 14) Reed-Muller code for the ACCH (broadcast block of
  each downlink burst)
lower_mac/tetra_scramb.[ch]
* Scrambling
lower_mac/viterbi*.[ch]
* Convolutional decoder for signalling and voice channels
phy/tetra_burst.[ch]
* Routines to encode continuous normal and sync bursts
phy/tetra_burst_sync.[ch]


Receiver Program
----------------

The main receiver program 'tetra-rx' expects an input file containing a
stream of unpacked bits, i.e. 1-bit-per-byte.


Transmitter Program
-------------------

The main program conv_enc_test.c generates a single continuous downlinc sync
burst (SB), contining:
	* a SYNC-PDU as block 1
	* a ACCESS-ASSIGN PDU as broadcast block
	* a SYSINFO-PDU as block 2

Scrambling is set to 0 (no scrambling) for all elements of the burst.

It does not actually modulate and/or transmit yet.


Quick example
=============

	# assuming you have generated a file samples.cfile at a sample rate of
	# 195.312kHz (100MHz/512 == USRP2 at decimation 512)
	src/demod/python/tetra-demod.py -i /tmp/samples.cfile -o /tmp/out.float -s 195312 -c 0
	src/float_to_bits /tmp/out.float /tmp/out.bits
	src/tetra-rx /tmp/out.bits
